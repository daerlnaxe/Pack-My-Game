# Pack-My-Game

Download folder: https://github.com/daerlnaxe/Pack-My-Game/tree/master/Releases  

## What it does:
 * It copies then compress everything about a game contained in the db of LaunchBox app.
 * It generates a short xml file with the main information about the game
 * It takes images, pdf manual, video, music, rom file.
 * It takes also the cheatcode files if you fill the path ('GameName-*.*')
 * It generates a tree view file.
 * Support Cue files (1.4+ versions)
 * 7z and zip compression
 * Backup datas about a game from LaunchBox xml
 * When PackMe run,  creates an enhanced xml file, adding missing paths, additionally to the original backup
 * Permits to choose manually video, music, manual if db don't mention paths.
 * Contextual menu permits now to make some operations to construct the workfolder, to compress it later.
	
## Why ?
 * Because as a french gamer i wanted to save everything i fill about my games and keep it
for later, just in case there was a problem. 

## Note
 * Use it only with roms and cue files since 23/08/2020
 * Don't move or delete files from the source (never)
 * It asks before to overwrite roms, manuals, music, video that are in the working directory meanwhile
 the copy (the target directory)
 * Currently it asks a global permission to overwrite for the image/pictures files, even if there is
no image file in the the destination folder.
 * The clones are added only if they are grouped with a main in LaunchBox
 * Compression 7z and zip
 * It logs everything during the game treatment in a window, and a file.

 * Bug Correction of unwanted space in "Cheats" Windows
 * Bug Correction of unwanted lines in "Cheats" Windows
 * Bug Correction when you erase system name
 * Bug Correction: Temporary solution. Currently sometimes there is a problem during compression, it's due to the
 access of the UI by another task. There is a call to avoid it in theory, but it seems sometimes there is a problem
 dispite of it. Then for the while this access are balised by a try/catch. It's not important because it's just very
 rare visual problem. I will try to resolve it because it's caused by another of my libraries, but i must use a bench
 protocol to reproduce the same condition.
