# Pack-My-Game

Download [PackMyGame-x86.zip](https://github.com/daerlnaxe/Pack-My-Game/blob/master/PackMyGame%20x86%20-%20A03.zip) or [PackMyGame-x64.zip](https://github.com/daerlnaxe/Pack-My-Game/blob/master/PackMyGame%20x64%20-%20A02.zip) for executable files  

## What it do:
 * It copies then compress everything about a game contained in the db of LaunchBox app.
 * It generates a short xml file with the main information about the game
 * It takes images, pdf manual, video, music, rom file.
 * It takes also the cheatcode files if you fill the path ('GameName-*.*')
 * It generates a tree view file.
 * 7z and zip compression
 * Backup datas about a game from LaunchBox xml
 * When PackMe run,  creates an enhanced xml file, adding missing paths, additionally to the original backup
 * Permits to choose manually video, music, manual if db don't mention paths.
 * Contextual menu permits now to make some operations to construct the workfolder, to compress it later.
	
## Why ?
 * Because as a french gamer i wanted to save everything i fill about my games and keep it
for later, just in case there was a problem. 

## Note
 * Use it only with roms.
 * Don't move or delete files from the source (never)
 * It asks before to overwrite roms, manuals, music, video that are in the working directory meanwhile
 the copy (the target directory)
 * Currently it asks a global permission to overwrite for the image/pictures files, even if there is
no image file in the the destination folder.
 * The clones are added only if they are grouped with a main in LaunchBox
 * Compression 7z and zip
 * It logs everything during the game treatment in a window, and a file.
		
## Version

### Beta 1.3.0.4: 08/09/2018

 * Packme: Filter clones * 
 * Contextual menu
 * Several manual operations from contextual menu (as zip, 7zip, make info, backup etc...)
 * PackMe: 'Bug' fixed: original xml can don't contain path for video, music, because it probably use
 an algorithm additionnaly to the db, now PackMyGame will search in dedicated folders and purpose you some
 occurences. If they are checked, it means they match to the habitual name system. Check or Uncheck according to your needs.
