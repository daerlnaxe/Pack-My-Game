## What it does:
 * It copies then compress everything about a game contained in the db of LaunchBox app.
 * You can reinject with unpack my game into your LaunchBox application.
 * See Wiki for more ...

 * It generates a short xml file with the main information about the game
 * It takes images, pdf manual, video, music, rom file.
 * It takes also the cheatcode files if you fill the path ('GameName-*.*')
 * It generates a tree view file.
 * Support Cue files (1.4+ versions)
 * 7z and zip compression
 * Backup datas about a game from LaunchBox xml
 * When PackMe run,  creates an enhanced xml file, adding missing paths, additionally to the original backup
 * Permits to choose manually video, music, manual if db don't mention paths.
 * ~~Contextual menu permits now to make some operations to construct the workfolder, to compress it later.~~
 * Unpack permits to reinject your game into LaunchBox
 * Calculate a sum file at the end of compression 
 * Extract datas abouts platform selected
 * Datas extracted (TBGame & TBPlatform) are verbatim, datas are direcly extacted from balises without using a container class. 
 * All copy of file is verified you can see it in logs.
	
## Why ?
 * Because as a french gamer i wanted to save everything i fill about my games and keep it
for later, just in case there was a problem. 

## Note
 * Use it only with roms and cue files (cue since 23/08/2020)
 * Don't move or delete files from the source (never)
 * It asks before to overwrite roms, manuals, music, video that are in the working directory meanwhile
 the copy (the target directory)
 * Currently it asks a global permission to overwrite for the image/pictures files, even if there is
no image file in the the destination folder. (28/10/2020 to Modify)
 * The clones are added only if they are grouped with a main in LaunchBox
 * Compression 7z and zip
 * It logs everything during the game treatment in a window, and a file.

### Alpha 2.0.0.0
 * Big changes, the application migrates to wpf system instead of forms.
 * .Net Core + .Net standard for external libraries.
 * Unpack released to reinject game into LaunchBox (several modes)
 * Calculates a md5 files after compression
 * extract datas about platform to keep it somewhere (a new mode will come to exploit this)
 * Datas extracted named True Backup doesn't use a class, to follow evolution of LaunchBox without managing. If there is no big update about xml files it must follow without problem all updates.
 * Big modifications about behavior for windows asking what to do in case of file conflict (split about memorized choices between images files and others).
 * Some minor bugs are know, refer to this section before to use it.
 * Split a big part of xml works to be reusable (you can use it but there is a lot of cleaning to do).
 * New system for localization for Pack-My-Game (uses xml files, you just need to copy us file, translate and if possible name like i did)
 * Still to have some localization to finish.
 * New system of limitation for characters in cheat code windows, old exists for the while by the button, use the checkbox for the newest)
 * There is no more verification before asking to user what to do, there is a verification only in case of copy.



### Beta 1.6.0.2 Work In Progress
 * Give a name when you want to choose to rename.
 * Correction for a windows, when you want to extend size to view files to get.
 * Modification for images: if there is one conflict, a box appears to ask what to do but only once (before it, you had to say before treatment what you would to do       "in case of")
 * New Feature: possibility to search a game directly on PackMeRes window 
 * Modification: Handles differently when the LaunchBox path is incorrect, at starting user is warned and the config file is no longer modified to remove the wrong path.
 * Modification: Handles differently when the Output path is incorrect, at starting  user is warned.
### Beta 1.6.0.1 27/10/2020
 * BugFix: don't copy several time the same roms (it  happened before when xml files had many occurs of a same file).
 * New Feature: System compare files by md5 sum, and ask nothing if sum are same, you have less windows to validate now.
   To add this new system, all algorithm have been modified.
 * New feature: A Window appears during compareason to indicate progression (it can be very quick for small size files).
 * New feature: Implementation for cheatcodes path when copying..
 * New feature: Renaming file for target in case of conflict and files are different, you can't overwrite it if you choose to rename. Each time, you try
   a window will ask you to give a filename that don't exist. It's a protection to avoid overwrite.
### Beta 1.6.0.x 22/20/2020
 * BugFix: Path Creation (images)
 * First implementation of new system to compare files (md5 support).

### Beta 1.5.0.4 10/10/2020
 * Bug Correction of unwanted space in "Cheats" Windows
 * Bug Correction of unwanted lines in "Cheats" Windows
 * Bug Correction when you erase system name
 * Bug Correction: Temporary solution. Currently sometimes there is a problem during compression, it's due to the
 access of the UI by another task. There is a call to avoid it in theory, but it seems sometimes there is a problem
 dispite of it. Then for the while this access are balised by a try/catch. It's not important because it's just very
 rare visual problem. I will try to resolve it because it's caused by another of my libraries, but i must use a bench
 protocol to reproduce the same condition.
 * Feature: open temp folder in explorer
 
 
### Beta 1.5.0.3 09/10/2020

 an algorithm additionnaly to the db, now PackMyGame will search in dedicated folders and purpose you some
 occurences. If they are checked, it means they match to the habitual name system. Check or Uncheck according to your needs.
